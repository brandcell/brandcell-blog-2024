“Yeah it be great if your team is able to present the metrics for the marketing work you have done so far, for us to better gauge the impact”.

Internally I scream, it’s going to be a long meeting. 

Normally I would jump in joy at the notion of a client that values analytics, the problem was that without context for analysing data, an analytics reporting meeting was doomed to be a mess of cherry-picked, lazily crafted narratives about driving traffic and an incoherent mess of reporting metrics that do not provide intelligence much less drive action, which was exactly what the meeting became. 

It’s data analysis for the sake of data analysis. 

Fortunately we have since learnt from that lesson, and that is why this article was written, to help e-commerce owners: 

    - Cut through the noise in marketing, resulting in shorter, more impactful meetings.
    - See how marketing moves fit into the larger goal of building an e-commerce marketing engine.

## The Big Picture

First we want to have a sense of the full puzzle, what we are working towards, and the metrics that matter, so that its easier to see how each of the smaller pieces fit into the puzzle. 

Growth of an e-commerce store depends on three things. These are : 

   - Capital (How much capital you are able to invest)
   - Customer Lifetime Value (How much profit you can get from a customer)
   - Costs of Acquisition (How much it costs to get a new customer)

We can present them in a growth equation as follows:

Effectively the equation tells us the return we will get out of capital. 

The goal, no matter what your business is, is to find the balance between each of the components that maximises the return for your capital.

That is where data comes in. Relevant marketing data informs us of the state of growth equation. For example, the costs of traffic driven to your store from Meta Ads, contributes in part to the Costs of Acquisition in the equation. By looking at metrics through the lens of the growth engine, you will be able to find opportunities for growth and streamline inefficiencies. 

Most importantly, you are clear on what actions to take and are confident that you are progressing towards maximising the growth of your store. We also put metrics into context, how it helps the return on the marketing budget, instead of looking at metrics by itself. 

Let’s explore each component and what are the marketing metrics that are relevant to them.

### Capital

To make money, you need to have money. Advertisements, agencies, and getting products into the hands of customers cost money, and each dollar deployed should bring more dollars in, or you won’t be in business for long. In the case of capital, the challenge is to find out how much capital to put in that will maximise the return. Here you want to have a keen understanding of how long it takes for you to generate a return on your marketing spend. 

A simple example: It costs $100 to acquire a customer who on average buys $20 a month will take 5 months to start generating a positive return. Hence there is a limit to how many times you are able to deploy capital, as you would only have $100 in cash every 5 months once you spend it on the customer. 

The goal for capital is to deploy as many times as possible, when paired with a positive return on investment, you will be able to generate that return multiple times in a year. But to do so requires you to balance costs of acquisition and the return you can get for each customer. 

### Customer Life Time Value

The value a business is able to extract from the customer throughout his lifetime. A customer doesn’t always only buy once when they know of your brand, so the actual return of a customer how much he spends over his lifetime. Typically this metric is monitored over a fixed period of time and for certain segments of customers. 

 An increasing customer lifetime value over time lets you know that customers are more comfortable with your brand, and sometimes a proxy for evaluating if long term branding efforts are paying off. 

Segments of increasing customer lifetime value will allow you to identify your ideal customer target profile, and personalise your messaging in a way that attracts more of them. 

We can increase lifetime values by: 

    - investing in brand awareness
    - increase average orders with upselling and bundling
    - implement loyalty programmes to keep customers coming back

### Costs of Acquiring a Customer

<ImageWithCaption src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dl3rdpbpw/image/upload/v1722093200/CAC_lwvjo1.png" alt='cac' caption='Costs of acquiring a customer is made up of the costs of traffic x the conversion rate'/>

In every advertising channel there are costs to acquire traffic. Costs varies from each advertising channel and industry, as ads operate in a bidding market with other advertisers.

Cost of traffic allows us to evaluate if we are advertising on the right platforms, as well as the effectiveness of our creatives, messaging and targeting strategies. 

For example, a brand that has a younger audience mix may see cheaper costs of traffic in Tiktok vs Facebook, and an effective creative may have cheaper costs of traffic than others. Therefore by monitoring costs of traffic across different channels, we can begin to understand customer behaviour. This will allow us to make better decisions in allocating advertising spend. 

### Conversion Rate

The rate of conversion is how much of the traffic actually turns into customers. A good conversion rate performs consistently over time and lets you know that you are able to scale your traffic, as you are confident that the traffic will convert into customers. It is one of the highest returning moves you can take as it is the closest to the purchase. 

The conversion rate measures the attractiveness of your offer,  the buying intent of your traffic, website speed, the design of your page from click to checkout, product/ service messaging fit.  

This allows you ran experiments in these areas, ensuring that your conversion rate is as high as it can possibly be. 

### Takeaways

Armed with the idea of the growth equation, we can put metrics into context, understand the status of the growth engine, identify opportunities for improvement and invest our marketing dollars with more confidence.
