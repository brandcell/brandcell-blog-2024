Every e-commerce business faces two key challenges:

    1. getting traffic to your store 

    2. turning that traffic into revenue.

Today, I'm going to take the position that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush and focus on problem 2. After all, we don't all have buckets of money to spend on ads for new traffic.

Instead we are going to look at the four key areas you can do to increase revenues from your existing traffic. We will discuss tactics, metrics and ways to find opportunities to do so!

The four key areas are:

Let's dive into each in more detail:

## Pillar 1 : Conversion 

Improving the conversion rate means turning more store visitors into purchasers. It is the foundational pillar of all the other pillars, as all other pillars depend on it.

Finding opportunities to improve conversions include listening closely to your customers. The key here is to identify the reason why people **don't** buy (and there will be plenty), and making changes according to the feedback.

### Finding Conversion Rate Improvement Opportunities

    - Implementing on-site polls
    - Run website usability audits.


### Example Tactics for Conversion Rates:

    - Welcome Offers
    - Streamlined Checkout Process
    - Implement Social Proof on Product Pages


### Metrics for Conversion Rates

    - Purchases
    - Checkouts Started
    - Add to Carts


## Pillar 2 : Spend

Improving spend largely means getting more revenue from your existing customer base.

Here we may immediately think about pushy upselling pop-ups , that ending up annoying customers and harming your store. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The key here is to offer meaningful, real value to your customers.

For example, if you are a music store, think bundling the sale of an electric guitar with an amp and strings, that suits the demands of your particular target audience.
