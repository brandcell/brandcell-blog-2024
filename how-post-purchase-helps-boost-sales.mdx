## Introduction 

Most brands mistakenly believe their sales process ends once the customer makes a purchase, in the contrary, post-purchase experience offers a significant opportunity to gain loyal customers who can generate repeat business. But what exactly goes into a good post-purchase experience? What are the steps involved, and how can you improve it? Today, we have gathered four methods to enhance your after-sales service and create a unique experience that encourages customers to return.

> According to a study by Nielsen, 92% of consumers trust    > recommendations from friends and family over any other form of advertising. A positive post-purchase experience can turn customers into brand advocates.

### 1. What happens after a customer pays?

The moment your customer pays, thats when you know they are the target audience you have been looking for. Instead spending money on throwing ads out, you can actually spend your time and effort in retaining these customers. 

While confirming a customer’s order is a great start, there’s so much more you can do with your “thank you” page. It’s the perfect opportunity to address post-purchase concerns, engage enthusiastic buyers, and even upsell. In fact, upselling at this stage can be far more effective than during the cart checkout, as the checkout should be as easy as possible.

Jordan Gal, founder of Carthook, explains, “Right after a purchase, customers are at their peak happiness. This is the ideal moment to make an offer. If done correctly, both sides benefit: the customer gets a product that enhances their experience, and you see increased order value at minimal extra cost.” Carthook has generated over $180 million dollar in additional revenue for its clients through post-purchase upsells.

#### When customers hit your thank you page, they’re already committed and ready to act. Use this opportunity to:

1. Suggest Bulk Purchases: Offer them additional items they might need in bulk, like extra light bulbs or pairs of socks, especially if they’re products they’ll buy regularly
2. Pitch a Subscription: For items they use frequently, like skincare products, propose an automatic renewal option.
3. Recommend Complementary Products: Suggest items related to their purchase, such as socks with shoes or pillows with a bedspread. Use your thank you page to highlight these helpful extras.

## 2. Help the customer feel better about their purchase. 

A happy customer will come back and keep spending when a brand delivers what makes them feel good. So how can you use this opportunity to reassure your customers that they have made a great choice by choosing to shop with you?

> Nielsen Global found that 66% of consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact. Among millennials, this number rises to 73%, indicating a strong preference among younger consumers for socially responsible brands.

After your customers place an order or while they are waiting for their shipment to arrive , its a good window of opportunity to:

- Share your company and team culture by showcasing team pictures and founder messages. Morning Consult survey found that customers value how a company treats its employees even more than whether items are in stock when they make a purchase.
- Advocate the charitable cause that you and your company support, that is cohesive to your brand value.
- Reassure customers about their purchase is to show them how happy other customers are with the same or similar items. 
- For expensive items, help customers see beyond the price tag by quantifying the long-term value. For instance, a good quality product that is more long lasting can actually help save them time and money in the long run. 

## 3. Optimizing Customer Support & Follow-up Emails 

It is important to let your customers understand that the quality of your product and service is trustable, and you are ready to answer any questions they might have. Ensure that customer support is easily accessible through various channels (email, chat, phone) and that inquiries are resolved quickly and effectively. Good post-purchase support can turn a one-time buyer into a loyal customer.

> Narvar conducted a survey in a pool of 1,543 shoppers between ages 21 and 65. Result shown that 83% of respondents expect regular updates about their purchases.

Turns out,  customers engage with post-purchase emails and messages more than any other communications. 
This raises an important question: Are you maximizing their potential?

#### How to optimise customer support through post-purchase service?

1. Send personalized follow-up emails or watsapp messages with product recommendations based on the customer’s purchase history. This can increase the likelihood of repeat purchases and build a stronger customer relationship.
2. Provide valuable content, such as care tips for the purchased product, tutorials, or related product suggestions. This enhances the user experience and keeps customers engaged with your brand.
3. Simplify the return and refund processes with clear instructions and easy-to-use online forms. A hassle-free return policy increases customer satisfaction and encourages future purchases.

## 4. Accumulate good reviews and feedbacks 

Encouraging customer feedback is crucial for refining your purchase experience. By simplifying feedback collection through surveys and review requests, you gain valuable insights that can continuously improve your services and products. Just as a customer journey map reveals how customers interact with your brand from discovery to repeat purchases, feedback helps you understand these interactions more deeply. Positive testimonials enhance your brand’s credibility, inspiring new customers and driving more sales. 

Additionally, use this opportunity to reward existing customers for their feedback. This approach fosters loyalty, encourages repeat business, and boosts site traffic and sales. If you're concerned about customers hesitating to leave reviews, here are several strategies to motivate them to share positive feedback on your site.

#### Incentives that you can give to gather feedback.

1. Offer a digital voucher code, so that customers can get a percentage off their next purchase for leaving a review.
2. Give loyalty points that can be redeemed for discounts, free shipping, or exclusive products.
3. Feature their review on your website or social media channels, giving them a shout-out for their feedback.
Offer a small cash back amount for every review submitted.

## 5. Have a Convenient Return and Exchange Policy 

The importance of having a refund policy is easy to overlook, but it plays a crucial role in boosting customer confidence before they place an order. It's also essential for preventing dissatisfaction if any issues arise during the purchase and delivery process. Some companies are known as much for their excellent products as they are for their generous, flexible, and seamless return policies. This ultimate safety net is to protect both you and your customers

> A survey done by UPS(2019) found that 73% of online shoppers said the returns experience affects their likelihood to purchase from a retailer again and 68% of shoppers check a retailer’s return policy before making a purchase.

#### How to Streamline Your Return Policy?


1. Offer Free Returns: Implement a policy that allows customers to return items without any cost, making the process hassle-free.
2. Provide Prepaid Return Labels: Include prepaid return labels with every order, so customers don't have to worry about shipping costs.
3. 24/7 Customer Support: Ensure your customer service is available around the clock to assist with any return-related issues, ensuring a smooth and straightforward process.
4. Enable Online Return Initiation: Allow customers to initiate returns through their online account with just a few clicks. Make the process highly automated, providing step-by-step instructions.
5. Instant Refunds: For certain items, offer instant refunds once the return is initiated, even before the item is shipped back, which speeds up the process and enhances customer satisfaction.
